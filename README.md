# Garbage Classification

A project done as part of a hackathon: 
using a pretrained efficientnet-litev4 model to train an image classification model on tensorflow lite that categorises garbage in the following categories: plastic, aluminium-foil, biological (food), book, brown-glass, cardboard, clothes, e-waste, green-glass, metal, paper, shoes, clear-glass, and trash.
