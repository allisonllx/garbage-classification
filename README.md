# garbage-classification

A project done as part of the uber global hackathon 2022: 
using a pretrained efficientnet-v4 model to train an image classification model on tensorflow lite that categorises garbage in the following categories: plastic, aluminium-foil, biological (food), book, brown-glass, cardboard, clothes, e-waste, green-glass, metal, paper, shoes, clear-glass, and trash.
