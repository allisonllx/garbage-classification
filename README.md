# Garbage Classification

A project done as part of a hackathon: 
training an image classification model on tensorflow lite using transfer learning (efficientnet-litev4 model) that categorises garbage in the following categories: plastic, aluminium-foil, biological (food), book, brown-glass, cardboard, clothes, e-waste, green-glass, metal, paper, shoes, clear-glass, and trash.
